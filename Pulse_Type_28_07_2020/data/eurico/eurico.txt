How to Generate Distance — Exercises on Ecology and Perception
Eurico Sá Fernandes


In the past years I’ve interests in ecological thinking in relation to perception and the role that technology plays in that realm. The way in which the current instability of Earth’s system brought to a new awareness of other beings and realities that cannot be totally grasped from human perception humans and the relation with the tools that are built to attempt to understand these. I believe this effort expands thinking into a realm where the human is no longer in the centre of world forcing us to think in a third-person perspective – not only in the impact that our actions have on us but on a system that might be outside our direct perception.
